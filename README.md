supplemental materials for 'Many At Once: Capturing Intentions to Create And Use Many Views At Once In Large Display Environments'


What is in this repository? 

This repository is an effort at open and transparant science.  We have included:

1. A copy of the paper, which outlines the goals, protocol, method, apparatus, recruitment protocol, and analysis methods in our evaluation. This is the first point of reference for the contents of this repository
2. The directory containing scenes- scenes were composed from videos and transcripts to allow for rapid review of the sessions, and to make clear the state of the display before and after participant requests.  These are numbered by participant, and numbered from 0-N which is a rough temporal order of the events in the session.  These scenes provide complete examples, when cross-referenced with our coding document, of each code we applied to the data. 
3. The directory containing visualizations provided to the participants, are a complete record of the templates used in the study.  These are numbered by response to participant request.  
4. The chat transcript directory records the text responses of the mediator to the participant
5. The Coding description document explains both the scene structure, order and composition as well as the coding scheme details 
6. The Templates and mediator response protocol document provides details about how the mediator responded to requests by the participant

We are delighted to respond to questions, and will update documents to include answers to these questions.  Please contact jillian.aurisano@gmail.com with all queries.
